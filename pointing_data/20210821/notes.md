1-2 test but too saturated
3 +50 to -50
4 -150 to +150 => only caught part
5 +150 to -150 => 200 sec exposure
6 -150 to +150 => 240 sec exposure

ok, that pattern looks pretty repeatable. center at 1585, 1537

7 5 sec exposure
8 1 sec => airy rings!
9 1 sec, rotator at zero => center at 1530, 1587.5
10 +10" in alt => center at 1555.6, 1583.2
11 +10" in az => center at 1538, 1615.5 => about 0.37"/pix

used offsets of -15 az and +24 alt to reel star into position of CoR from above.

12 150 to -150 at elevation of 25 => center of rot at 1569, 1541
13 -150 to 150 at elevation of 45 => no background stars
14 150 to -150 with 350" offsets in az and alt => 1569, 1537
15 -150 to 150 with 350" offsets at elevation of 77 => 1569, 1537
